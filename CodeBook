# CodeBook

The `run_analysis.R` script performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project’s definition.

1. Download the dataset
Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset

2. Assign each data to variables
* features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns
* activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
* subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
* x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
* y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
* subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
* x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
* y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns

3. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
* X (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
* Y (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
* subject (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
DT (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging subject, Y and X using cbind() function

4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
DT (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting DT, selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Entire numbers in code column of the DT replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable

6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
code column in DT renamed into activities
All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
mean.DT (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing DT taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
Export FinalData into FinalData.txt file.
